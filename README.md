# Calorie Counter

Getting and staying healthy requires a combination of mental balance,
exercise, and nutrition. The goal of the Calorie Counter app is to help the
user address nutritional needs by counting calories for various foods.

This app provides the number of calories based on the result of a user search
for a type of food. The U.S. Department of Agriculture MyPyramid Food Raw Data
will be searched to determine the calorie values.
